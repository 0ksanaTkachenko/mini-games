                    <p>The history of the game "Snake" began several years before the advent of the first mobile phones. In 1977, Gremlin Industries released the arcade machine "Hustle." To win, players needed to score more points than their opponent or beat the record set on the arcade machine.</p>
                    <p>The mobile version of "Snake" appeared on Nokia phones in 1997. The developer was Taneli Ormanto, who admitted that he had never created mobile games before. The game area, where the snake moved, was limited by the screen size of the phone. If the snake's head hit the edge of the phone, the game ended. "Snake" gained incredible popularity. In the second part of the game, the snake did not "die" by hitting the edge of the screen but crawled out from the opposite part of the display. Additionally, obstacle cards were introduced, and players could not collide with them.</p>
                    <p> Subsequently, Nokia released several more parts of the game with improved graphics and Bluetooth multiplayer for colored phones. In January 2005, a new version of the game was developed. This time, the game was already in 3D, and the graphics matched the level of the Sony PlayStation. The next version of the game only differed in the realism of the graphics.</p>
                    <p>After 2008, the legendary "Snake" no longer evolved. The era of button phones passed, and the game was not entirely suitable for touchscreen mobile devices. Nevertheless, people continue to play "Snake" even now. Despite the technological shifts, "Snake" remains a timeless classic, symbolizing the nostalgic era of early mobile gaming. Its simplistic gameplay has left an enduring mark on the history of mobile entertainment, showcasing the enduring popularity of this game.</p>
